## Welcome to Messaging

Solutions to bad code, because code sucks and guess what I'm going to make it better because who knew installing a certain piece of software for developers required experience just to do that. People should be able to start doing code with ease, continue to do it with ease, AND STOP USING TERMINAL FOR EVERYTHING.

If you're wondering why we have such a weird name it's a long story and just like any other name for a github project, we made it semi-confusing and weird enough where you don't know what the heck you're even looking for. In other words, it sucks, because when you search google for say an easy to use solution for every single one of your coding and developing needs you don't get anything because it mostly doesn't exist and what does exist has some obscure name.

### Making things Not Suck

So, how do we start. Oh yes, let's start by creating simple terms and easy-to-install packages (in the form of .pkg, .dmg, and your favorite, .exe) and while we're at it, make things easy to read and maybe tell people who don't understand how to actually do something. Unlike cooking, for example, not everyone needs to code and it should be expected that the normal person does not want to read for an hour about how to make a cool looking button to go well with their website. Now, this is sort of a bad example because people genuinely suck at cooking, can't you guys just figure out how to make a pancake, it's just cook, flip, and done.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, let's go over some simple coding stuff.

```markdown
Welcome to the CODE BLOCK! This is where we share our code with you, it makes it easy to know when we're giving code and so the computer doesn't think I'm trying to type HTML for showing how small my headings can get.

Speaking of headings, let's try a few thousand!

<h1>Big Heading!</h1>

Okay, so this is the biggest heading you're gonna get. Also, quick side note, in HTML we use "tags" and they usually start with two of these guys <, for example, <p>, and they end with two of these guys <, and one of these guys /, for example, </p>. This just tells the computer when to start and when to end, it's fairly intuitive until you have to type all these characters all the time, it gets annoying pretty quick.

<h2>Heading 1 out of 1,000</h2>

Okay, so here's the second heading. See where I'm going here, the headings get smaller the higher the number which is nice because smaller equals bigger according to computers.

Now let's get to the good old regular text with a font so generic it almost makes you want to puke.

<p>Regular text</p>

Now I know I keep bashing code but HTML is fairly straightforward, the problem is you can't do much with it because somebody decided that learning one language wasn't enough.

Welcome to the WORLD OF JAVA! It's so vast that, wait, did that button just make that other thing change? JAVA! It's like the director of your website, you can't live without it (unless you like a whole lot of text and headings and maybe some really bad buttons that take you to other website and nothing else). Anyways, Java uses up a lot of lines. How many lines you may ask...

import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Main { 
  public static void main(String[] args) { 
    ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
    cars.add("Volvo");
    cars.add("BMW");
    cars.add("Ford");
    cars.add("Mazda");
    for (int i = 0; i < cars.size(); i++) {
      System.out.println(cars.get(i));
    }
  } 
}

...And do you know what that did? It listen 4 cars, so if you thought HTML was confusing, think again.
                                    
Now you might think that we're done with the whole learning new and inconvenient languages, right? WRONG! Welcome to CSS, the small but significant language controlling all of your puke-inducing generic fonts and colors. Do you like spinning buttons? CSS! Do you like colorful buttons? CSS! Do you like... okay you probably get the point. CSS is what turns a textbook into a webpage worth reading, albeit a still boring and worthless page without Java but it's not bad. In other words, it's not a complete and utter noob "website" that just looks like a crappy 1995 fiver-year-old freelancer who made it on fiverr for five dollars.
      
Now I know what you're going to say. This website isn't looking so hot either, but that's not the point. I'm not here to make a pretty website, you are. The wonderful thing is that there is a lot of good stuff out there for you to use, I'll be adding stuff on here occasionally but websites like W3 Schools are good because they actually explain it to you like the dumb peanut-brained id10t you are.
